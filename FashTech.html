                        <p>  As a creative I have always been intersted in exploring opportunities to innovate otherwise mundane everyday experiences, I find that there is potential all around us waiting to be explored.
                        <p> This is the reason why I use research and conceptual thinking to create solutions that will hopefully enhance the users relationships to consumer products and services.</p>
                        <p>These methods are applied while assisting ethical and innovative processes during their development/delivery to bridge traditional manufacturing with disruptive technologies.</p><br>

                                 <p> During this time I was given the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of FashTech.</p>
                                 <p> I was tasked with project-lead for the curation of the FashTech paviljon.</p>
                                 <p> For nine months I got to immerse myself in the world of Fash Tech and deepened my understanding on the manne.</p><br>
                                 <p> This adventure resulted in: a three day-long expedition exhibiting international design pioneers within material development, sustainability and health tech and eductaion allunder one roof.</p>

Scanned tags would also help set the mood by bringing the wearer to a collection inspired playlist.</p>

                                <p> The three main subjects, culture, empworment and diversity.</p><p> These messages were embedded into the prints of the collection pieces using Augmented reality.</p>
                                <p> Each garment had a hidde message printed on them that could be unlocked by using your phone to show the wearer that they are not alone as you are me and "I am you".</p>

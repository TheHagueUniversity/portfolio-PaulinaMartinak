            <p> Ever since I first started studying I went back and forward between Design and Technology.
            </p><p>This why I love how the two are becoming more interlinked than ever before.</p>
            <p> Throughout the years I have come to see that my strength lies in development stages of the creative process.</p>
            <p> Becoming a UX-design designer is a great way to further develop my ressearch skills while still actively work with interactive technolgies.

                          <p> For the project bespoke design I got the opportunity to work with direct users and company clients for the first time as a UX-design student.</p><br>
                         <p>The project consisted of two main parts, during the first part I was assigned a user in order to practice my research and observational skills by working within the different creative stages of the design process. For this assignment the most important faces where the emphatize face as we were tasked to create a tool that allows it's users to create tailor made personal experiences to be shared with loved ones. The goal of the project was to create a card personalization tool as well as gift unwrapping experience that would connect past, present and future family generations.</p>

                             Having formed an initial idea about the project and having gained insights from our users it was time to let go of judgements heading into the second stage namely defining our final concept.</p>

                         <p>I choose to work with a dance workout group named "Salsation". The goal of this assignment was to learn about the social demographics that might influence gym-goers to join group workouts. Another point of research was to understand if cutltural differences halted of even boosted the participants to take part in the class.</p>

                            <p> The first part of my project consisted out of a lot of field research. The reasoning behind this is that I wanted to learn more about the differences and unifying factors between the different members of the dance group. For this I used the Fly on the wall technique, furthermore I made observations and took notes from video recordings and voice notes.. </p>

                            <p>Having attented several of the classes really helped me gain their confidence and also helped me in emphatizing with their community
                            I was invited to take part in extra curicular activities durin which I learned more about their drive and what makes this class som important to them.</p>

                              </a> <p> The results of this research were surprising as my assumptions were not as I had believed when starting the project. The groups showed that their bond had little to do with direct cultural background but more about the need of feeling connected and happy. This was a great project from where I improved my documentation methods as well as learned to better disect user insights.</p>

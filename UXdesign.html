            <p> Ever since I first started studying I went back and forward between Design and Technology.
            </p><p>This why I love how the two are becoming more interlinked than ever before.</p>
            <p> Throughout the years I have come to see that my strength lies in development stages of the creative process.</p>
            <p> Becoming a UX-design designer is a great way to further develop my ressearch skills while still actively work with interactive technolgies. 
            I am happy to share my first results and learnings with you. Let's have look...</p>

                         <p>The project consisted of two main parts, during the first part I was assigned a user in order to practice my research and observational skills by working within the different creative stages of the design process. For this assignment the most important faces where the emphatize face as we were tasked to create a tool that allows it's users to create tailor made personal experiences to shared with loves ones.</p>
